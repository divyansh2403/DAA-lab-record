# DAA-Lab-Record

## 📘 About  
This repository contains implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) lab experiments. It includes a variety of problems solved in C and C++.  
The purpose is to provide a working lab record for the DAA (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) course.

## ✅ Contents  
Here is a high-level overview of the files included:

- `BubbleSort.cpp` — Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.  
- `insertionSort.cpp` — Implementation of Insertion Sort.  
- `quick_sort.cpp` — Quick Sort implementation.  
- `search_linear_binary.cpp` — Linear search and binary search implementations.  
- `strassen_matrix.cpp` — Implementation of the Strassen’s matrix multiplication algorithm.  
- `traveling_salesman.cpp` — A solution approach to the Traveling Salesman Problem.  
- `ConvexHull.c` — Implementation of a Convex Hull algorithm (in C).  
- `Huffman.cpp` — Huffman coding algorithm implementation.  
- `Knapsack.cpp` — Knapsack problem implementation.  
- `LCS.cpp` — Longest Common Subsequence implementation.  
- `NQueen.c` — N-Queens problem implementation (in C).  
- …and possibly more as you expand.

## 🛠 Setup & Usage  
To compile and run each of the experiments, follow these generic steps (assuming a Unix/Linux environment):  

1. Open a terminal in the folder containing the source file.  
2. Compile the source (example):  
   ```bash
   g++ BubbleSort.cpp -o BubbleSort   # for C++ files  
   gcc ConvexHull.c -o ConvexHull     # for C files  
Run the executable:

bash
Copy code
./BubbleSort
Input data (if the program requires), and observe the output.

Modify or extend the code as needed for practice or experiments.

Note: If you are using Windows, you may compile via g++/gcc using MinGW, or use an IDE that supports C/C++.

🎯 Learning Goals
By working through this repository you will:

Gain hands-on experience implementing classic algorithms and data structures.

Understand the time-complexity, space-complexity, and performance trade-offs of different approaches.

Improve proficiency in writing C/C++ code for algorithmic problems.

Have a reference lab record that can help during revision or further coursework.
